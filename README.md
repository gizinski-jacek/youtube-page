# YouTube Front and Video

Building YouTube Front and Video pages to polish my skills after going through The Odin Project's HTML course on embedding images and videos, tables, lists, forms and CSS course on positioning, floats, flexbos, grid, backgrounds and gradients.

###### This project is mostly finished.
